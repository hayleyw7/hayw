# Hayley Witherell — Portfolio

A responsive React portfolio built with Vite and deployed to GitHub Pages at [hayw.dev](https://hayw.dev).

## Technology

- React 19 and Vite
- JavaScript and Sass/SCSS
- ESLint
- Cypress and cypress-axe (end-to-end and accessibility tests)
- GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages

## Site structure

The page is a single scrolling portfolio with alternating light and dark sections:

| Section | Hash | Contents |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Hero** | `#header` | Gradient header, cloud animation, Embark CTA |
| **About** | `#about` | Bio (`#profile`), portrait, and tech stack (`#skills`) |
| **Impact** | `#impact` | Professional and community impact |
| **Recommendations** | `#recommendations` | Quotes grouped by company |
| **Portfolio** | `#portfolio` | Video games and web applications |
| **Recognition** | `#recognition` | Awards, panels, and media coverage |
| **Contact** | `#contact` | Invitation text, social links, and email |

After scrolling past the hero, a **sticky section nav** appears with links to each major section. Nav items stay aligned to section boundaries (accounting for nav height), update `aria-current="page"` as you scroll, and support direct hash URLs such as `/#portfolio`.

The contact footer plays a short icon animation when you navigate to it from the section nav.

## Project layout

```
src/
  components/     Section UI (Header, SectionNav, Introduction, Portfolio, etc.)
  data/           Content datasets — edit these to update site copy and links
  styles/         SCSS partials composed through index.scss
  utils/          Scroll helpers and active-section detection for the nav
public/
  images/         Portrait, favicon, social preview
  assets/         Static overlays and Font Awesome webfonts
cypress/
  e2e/            End-to-end specs grouped by concern (21 files)
  fixtures/       contracts.js — shared expectations for content tests
```

### Content files

| File | What it drives |
|------|----------------|
| `skills.js` | Tech stack chips in About |
| `impact.js` | Impact section copy |
| `recommendations.js` | Recommendation cards |
| `projects.js` | Portfolio groups and project cards |
| `recognition.js` | Recognition groups |
| `socialLinks.js` | Footer social and email links |
| `sectionNav.js` | Sticky nav labels and scroll targets |

Components import the data file they need. `cypress/fixtures/contracts.js` mirrors the public content contracts used by tests — update both when changing headings, skills, or section IDs.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Quality checks

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

`test:e2e` starts the Vite dev server and runs the full Cypress suite. Use `npm run cypress:open` for interactive debugging while the dev server is running.

The Cypress suite has **21 spec files** and **132 tests** covering:

| Area | What it checks |
|------|----------------|
| `01-smoke` | Preload timing, portrait loading, top-level render order |
| `02-content` | Section headings, skills, impact, recommendations, projects, recognition, metadata |
| `03-links` | External link labels, `noopener`/`noreferrer`, and safe destinations |
| `04-accessibility` | axe WCAG A/AA, keyboard tab order, landmarks, semantics, and `aria-current` nav state |
| `05-interactions` | Embark scroll, sticky section nav, hash routing, scroll alignment, hover states |
| `06-responsive` | Desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts (320px–1280px), section padding, touch targets |
| `07-visual` | Section colors and `prefers-reduced-motion` behavior |
| `08-resilience` | Portrait failure, runtime errors, and direct hash routes |

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` trigger the GitHub Pages workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (Node 20, `npm ci`, `npm run build`, deploy `dist/`).
